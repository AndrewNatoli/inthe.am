Contribution Guidelines
=======================

Contributions are welcome -- especially for bug fixes -- but, if you
would like to add a new feature, *please* open up a new issue in
the `issue tracker <https://github.com/coddingtonbear/inthe.am/issues>`_
or discuss the proposed changes with ``coddingtonbear`` in
``##inthe.am`` on Freenode before getting started to ensure work is not
already ongoing toward solving your problem -- nobody likes wasting their
time!
