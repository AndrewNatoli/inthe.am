                For your security, the ability to send task messages via
                SMS is currently disabled for your account since you
                have not yet entered your Twilio auth token.
            </p>
            <p>
                This token is necessary for verifying that incoming messages
                were sent to Inthe.AM by Twilio from your account.

    <h3>Setup Instructions</h3>

    <p>
        Inthe.am can receive and add items to your task list via SMS, but
        it requires a little bit of configuration on your part.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Sign up for a <a href="https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio">Twilio account</a>.</li>
        <li>
            Add funds to your twilio account. At the time of writing,  Twilio charges
            around $0.01 for each incoming or outgoing SMS message (incoming messages are slightly cheaper),
            and each phone number costs $1.00/month.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://www.twilio.com/user/account/phone-numbers/available/local">Buy a phone number</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            From your phone number's configuration screen, set the field "Messaging Request URL" to
            your personal incoming SMS URL: <code>https://inthe.am{{ controllers.application.urls.sms_url }}</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Press save.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        After you have configured the above, you can send SMS messages to your
        Twilio phone number.  Currently, the only command implemented is 'add',
        but in the future additional commands may be added.
    </p>
    <p>
        As an example, you could add a task to the project "birthday" with a due
        date of tomorrow and high priority by sending an SMS message with the following
        contents:
        <pre>add project:birthday due:tomorrow priority:h It's my birthday</pre>
    </p>
    {{partial "footer"}}
